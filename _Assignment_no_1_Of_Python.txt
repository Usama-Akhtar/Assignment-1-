  ASSIGNMENT NO.1 OF PYTHON!!
  
# Q1: Take input first name and last name from user store in two variables and then concatenate both variables and print full name.

First_Name=(input("Enter First Name: "))  
Last_Name=(input("Enter Last Name: "))
First_Name +" "+Last_Name



# Q2: Write a Python program to take input from user as a string then print first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string.  

# Input any string!
X = input("Enter any string: ")
#Print first two characters here..,
print(X[:2])
#Print Last two characters here..,
print(X[-2:])



# Q3 Write a Python program to remove the “h” character from the “TechShoor”.

# Given string
Var = "Techshoor"
# Remove "h" from given string
Var = Var.replace("h","")
print(Var)



# Q4 Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically).Sample Words: car, bike, truck, cycle, skateboard, civic"

# Arrange the list in sorted order.
items = input("Input comma separated sequence of words: ")
words = (word for word in items.split(","))
print("Sorted list:" ,",".join(sorted(words)))




#Q5 Write a Python Program take sample string: “I am a bad person” to replace with “I am a good person”. Hint (Use replace function)

# Given sample string.
sample_string = ("I am a bad person. ")
# Replacement in sample string.
sample_string = sample_string.replace("bad","good")
print(sample_string)


# Q6 Write a Python program to reverse any string.

#Input any string.
String = (input("Enter any string: "))
#Reverse string.
print("Reverse string:" ,String[::-1])



#Q7: Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area 

from math import pi
# Input radius of the circle.
r = float(input ("Input the radius of the circle : "))
# Compute the area of a circle with radius.
print ("The area of the circle with radius " + str(r) + " is: " + str(pi * r**2))  



# Q8 Write a Python Program to count how many times ‘o’ in “Gooooooooooooooooogle"

# Count "o" in a given string.
String = "Gooooooooooooooooogle"
print("O in a given string is:" ,String.count("o"))   



#Q9 Create a Python Program to slice this string “I like to eat banana” and print only “ike to eat"

# Input given string.
str = "I like to eat banana"
# Select string of index from 3 to 13.
print(str[3:13])


# Q10 Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format. (see Output)

# Print the given string in specific format.
my_str = """Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\n  How I wonder what you are!\n        Up above the world so high,\n        Like a diamond in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,\n  How I wonder what you are\n"""
